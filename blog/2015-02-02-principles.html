			<h1>Principles behind an open data board game</h1>
			<h2>Feb 2nd 2015</h2>
			<p>At our first internal board game workshop, we crowd sourced principles to guide the board game design process - what people like and what they want to avoid. These were the results:</p>
			<h2>What we want:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It should challenge how we think about sharing data and open data.</li>
				<li>It should be collaborative.</li>
				<li>It should be fun, but with a lot at stake immediately.</li>
				<li>It should explain what open data is.</li>
				<li>It should be aimed at ages 9+. Simple enough for new players, but not so simple. Family friendly - perhaps with an 'easy' version and harder extension.</li>
				<li>It should be lush. It should be engaging</li>
				<li>It should be tactile. There should be physical things to pass around.</li>
				<li>There should be an element of chance/luck/randomness.</li>
				<li>It should be a reflection of the open data community - fun, open, random.</li>
				<li>It should be extendable. We should be able to add extra cards, pieces, levels of complexity.</li>
				<li>There should be stacking pieces.</li>
				<li>It should take into account things like colour blindness. But it should be colourful!</li>
				<li>It should involve building a data commons - constructing a data board.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>It would be nice to have:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Collaborative but with the ability to win individually!</li>
				<li>Support for a two player version</li>
				<li>Being finished in 45 minutes (once you know how to play)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What we want to avoid</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Gimmicks.</li>
				<li>Being shallow.</li>
				<li>QR codes. Obviously.</li>
				<li>An easily lost important game piece.</li>
				<li>Long complex instructions.</li>
				<li>Being too complex to remember/play.</li>
				<li>Being laborious.</li>
				<li>Being "UK/English centric" - culturally and linguistically.</li>
				<li>Being breakable.</li>
				<li>Being boring.</li>
				<li>Having a long period where it's obvious who's won, or lost, or whole game won/lost.</li>
				<li>Game set up that's longer than 5 minutes.</li>
				<li>Being too focused on data and not on impact.</li>
				<li>Being too 'geeky' - needs to appeal to the masses.</li>
				<li>Players being kicked out of gameplay.</li>
				<li>Maths.</li>
				<li>Having a long time where a player isn't doing anything/ doesn't need to pay attention.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>We'll try to avoid</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Dice games (maybe)</li>
				<li>Having too many bits and pieces in the box</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>If people could only take away one message about open data, it would be:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It's about impact - social, environmental, economic.</li>
				<li>Open data helps us as a society to address the big challenges.</li>
				<li>Open data is more valuable the more of it there is.</li>
				<li>Open data is a thing. The thing is good.</li>
				<li>Public benefits all. Private benefits only some.</li>
				<li>This stuff is not difficult.</li>
				<li>Data is not just for geeks.</li>
			</ul>
