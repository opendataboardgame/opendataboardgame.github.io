			<h1>How to play</h1>
			<p><em>You can play two different versions of Datopolis</em></p>
			<p>
				The <b>warm-up version</b> teaches you how to negotiate and build with
				data (20-30 minutes)
			</p>
			<p>
				The <b>full version</b> allows you to take on different player roles
				in the town of Sheridan, with competing winning conditions. You must
				work together to respond to environmental, economic and social crises
				in the town (45 minutes - 1 hour).

			<h1>How Datopolis works</h1>
			<section class="dataTiles">
				<h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">The aim of the game is to create tools using data tiles. </h2>

			<h1>Warm up game (20-30 minutes)</h1>

				In this game you will build tools using data tiles that might be
				'open' or 'closed' data. The pattern of tiles that emerges is
				called the 'data infrastructure'. The first player to complete 10
				points worth of tools is the winner.

								<li>
									Take a data tile from the bag into your hand.
								</li>
								<li>
									Look at the data tiles you have in your hand, your tool cards
									and data that has already been laid. Negotiate with other
									players. When you think you can build something:
									<ul>
										<li>
											Place the tool card face up in front of you so
											everyone can see what you're building.
										</li>
										<li>
											Place a use marker on every data tile you used to create
											the tool - including data tiles that already have use
											markers on them - so everyone can check that the pattern
											on the card matches the data you're using.
										</li>
										<li>
											Make up a name for the tool, and tell everyone what it
											is and what it does.
										</li>
									</ul>

									You can create more than one tool during your turn, if you're
									able to. When you've finished, you have the option of

			<h1>Full game (45 minutes - 1 hour)</h1>
			<p>
				The full game works in the same way as the warm up version, except
				each player is working towards a different goal, and the life of
				the town is declining. This version of the game introduces some new
				elements:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Town dashboard
					</li>
					<li>
						Impact scores
					</li>
					<li>
						Events
					</li>
					<li>
						Roles
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<section class="dataTiles">
				<subsection class="toolCardContainers">

					<container class="toolCardContainer toolCardContainer_two">
						<h3>The dashboard</h3>
						<p>
							This keeps track of the life of the town: its people, economy and
							environment. Every turn, event cards may lower the dashboard
							scores, but making tools can increase them. Different players
							have different roles and different goals as a result. It's possible
							for everyone to lose, or for everyone to win, or for only some
							players to win.

				<subsection class="toolCardContainers">
					<h3>Having an impact</h3>
					<container class="toolCardContainer toolCardContainer_four">
						<p>
							Tools that you create have an impact which
							increases the scores on the dashboard. There are three different
							types of impact: economic, social and environmental.
							Some tools can have different options for impact. You can choose <b>which</b>
							impact a tool has when you build it, but you can only choose one
							of the available options. <b>A tool cannot have multiple impacts.</b>
						</p>
						<h3>Example</h3>
						<p>
							This tool is a mobile app of local public clinics. It uses
							democratic data (yellow), health data (red) and geospatial data
							(green). <br>
							If you build it, you can choose to either increase the social
							score on the dashboard or increase the environmental score. The
							social and environmental icons are shown as options in colour,
							while the economic icon is grey to show that it isn't an option
							for this tool.

					<h2>The end of the game</h2>
					<p>
						Rather than a single winner, the full version of the game has three
						scenarios that bring the game to an end.
					</p>
					<h3>High score</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
						    If any player has created 10 points worth of tools the game is
								over.There will be some winners and some losers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Each player must show their role card and say whether they have
						    won or lost. Try not to end the game by creating 10 points of
						    tools if you're not going to win.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h3>Utopia</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If all the impact scores on the dashboard get to +4 the town
						    has become a utopia.
							</li>
							<li>
								Everybody wins! (We think this is technically impossible ...).
							</li>
						</ul>
			  	</p>
					<h3>An emergency response</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								If any impact score on the dashboard is at -4 at the
						    beginning of any player's turn, the town is in a precarious
				    		state. This player has one last chance to build a tool or
			    			tools in an emergency response - collaboration with fellow
				    		players will be key!
							</li>
							<li>
								During the emergency response turn, each completed tool will be
					    	worth two points. The emergency response phase can only be used
			    			twice in the game. If any impact scores get to -4 a third time,
				    		or if you don't lift the score from -4 during the emergency
				    		response, it's game over! Everybody loses.

			<h1>Why we built Datopolis</h1>
			<!-- images of play tests & photo credits -->
			<p>
				The warm up version of Datopolis has been useful for team away days,
				data workshops and strategy sessions in a range of organisations.
				The full version is more suited to boardgame lovers like us who like
				a bit more complexity.
			</p>
			<h3>
				We play a lot of board games, and we spend lots of our time talking
				about data and open data. Datopolis lets us introduce data in a
				tactile, engaging way.
			</h3>
			<p>
				We created Datopolis in the open, using feedback from playtesting
				sessions for more than 12 months. The components are available for
				printing and editing on GitHub and we'll continue to improve it based
				on your feedback. The majority of Datopolis is openly licensed; you
				can change the rules, the cards, the tiles, translate it and localise
				it as long as you attribute the Open Data Institute and Folk Labs.
				You can even sell your version if you want. The only exception is
				for the box and illustrations in the instructions, which cannot be
				used for commercial purposes.
			</p>
			<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

				missed your name off!<br>
				A very special thankyou to Folk Labs, who put in lots of hard work
